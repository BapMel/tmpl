# tmpl
TMPL (pronounced "temple") is a Turing Machine Programming Language.

This is the initial version of TMPL, written in 2008. 

It comes with sample programs (some of them being finite, others infinite, 
others intentionally bugged) and the documentation.

- tmpl                           --> the program (with comments in French)
- progs                          --> sample programs in TMPL
- progs/00-finite_programs       --> finite TMPL programs you can just execute
- progs/01-infinite_programs     --> infinite TMPL programs (execute step by step)
- progs/02-intentionally_bugged_programs         --> syntaxically invalid programs
- doc/                           --> the documentation
